title: Multitenancy and RBAC
teaser: Learn how to manage multitenancy in kasten using OIDC and kubernetes RBAC,
  on a single cluster or in a multicluster situation
description: |-
  In order to allow kasten to be used by different users with different
  capacity we need to implement multitenancy in Kasten, this can be done using an
  identity provider and RBAC rules. In this track you're going to learn both. Multicluster is
  a typical multitenancy use case, where you want to give different capacity to different user per cluster.
