title: Application consistency with Kasten
teaser: Understand how you can implement consistency with Kasten
description: |-
  Kasten by default take the snapshot path to backup your stateful workload. It's the simplest and more
  straigth forward approach to protect your data because your backup are crash consistent and at least you
  export a copy of your data in an external storage.
  ##
  However being crash consistent does not mean being application consistent. For performance
  reason databases keep in memory many datas and flush them to the disk at specific intervals. Hence
  the state of the disks is not necessary the state of the database. Hopefully Kasten integrates with the
  Kanister project to help you build consistent backup.
